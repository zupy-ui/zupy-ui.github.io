# Using with AI (https://zupy-ui.github.io/docs/ai.md)

The docs are written so coding agents can read them as easily as people can.

## llms.txt [#llmstxt]

| URL               | Contents                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [`/llms.txt`](/llms.txt)           | An index of every page with a short summary |
| [`/llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt) | Every page in full, in one file             |

Paste either link into your agent, or add it to your project's rules file.

## Markdown pages [#markdown-pages]

Add `.md` to any docs URL to get the page as plain Markdown, for example [`/docs/components/button.md`](/docs/components/button.md). Requests that send `Accept: text/markdown` get the Markdown version automatically.

Every page also has a **Copy Markdown** button at the top.

## Rules for your agent [#rules-for-your-agent]

Add something like this to your `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`:

```md
## UI

- Use components from `@zupy/ui`. Docs: https://zupy-ui.github.io/llms.txt
- Style with zupy tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-muted`, `rounded-lg`), not raw colors.
- For custom raised surfaces use the `raised`, `filled` and `pressable` utilities
  instead of writing box shadows by hand.
- Pass `render` to change the element, e.g. `<Button render={<a href="/" />}>`.
```

## Typed and documented [#typed-and-documented]

Every component and prop has a JSDoc comment with an example, so agents get the same guidance in the editor as on this site.
